using a restaurant franchise management example.

This is the final project on the Codecademy **Learn Python 3** course and is
being expanded showcase modular design and clean architecture.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into separate modules to reflect real-world
application design:

- `franchise.py` – Defines the Franchise class and restaurant locations
- `business.py` – Defines the Business class and business ownership
- `main.py` – Entry point that imports and runs the application

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-oriented programming (classes and methods)
- Encapsulation and responsibility separation
- Cross-module imports
- Real-world data modeling
- Clean project structure

## How to Run
From the project directory:

```bash
python main.py
